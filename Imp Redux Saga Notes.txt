In React, Redux Saga is a middleware library that allows you to write asynchronous code that is easier to read, write, and test. It provides several helper functions such as `takeEvery()`, `takeLatest()`, `all()`, `takeEvery()`, and `call()` that make it easier to handle asynchronous actions in your application. ¹²⁴

- `put()` is used to dispatch an action.
- `call()` is used to call a function.
- `takeEvery()` is used to listen for every action of a certain type.
- `takeLatest()` is used to listen for the latest action of a certain type.
- `all()` is used to run multiple sagas at the same time.

In Redux Saga, `takeEvery()` and `takeLatest()` are both used to listen for actions of a certain type. The difference between them is that `takeEvery()` will listen for every action of that type and run the saga each time an action is dispatched, while `takeLatest()` will only listen for the latest action of that type and cancel any previous sagas that are still running before running the latest one. ¹⁴⁵
